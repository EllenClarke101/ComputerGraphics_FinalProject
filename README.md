# ComputerGraphics_FinalProject


This is my final project for Computer Graphics CSU44052. I spent a very long time trying to implement the robot into my project but was unsuccessful so I have added a folder called lab4, where you can see my skeleton and character animations seperately.

To Run Project:
- cd ComputerGraphics_FinalProject
- Delete the cmake-build-debug and generate your own using cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug
- cd cmake-build-debug
- cmake --build .
- ./city

You can also move forward, backward, left and right using WASD

To Run Animation:
- cd lab4 - Animation Example
- Delete the cmake-build-debug and generate your own using cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug
- cd cmake-build-debug
- cmake --build .
- ./lab4_skeleton or ./lab4_character
